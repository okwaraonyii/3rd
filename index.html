      <blockquote>
          “I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination.
           I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons 
           live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope 
           to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared 
           to die. ”
<h5>Speech from the Dock quote by Nelson Mandela on 20 April 1964</h5>
